You are attempting to use Flash Attention 2.0 with a model not initialized on GPU. Make sure to move the model to GPU after initializing it on CPU with `model.to('cuda')`.

[rank1]:[W125 20:02:14.613474976 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:4561] [PG ID 0 PG GUID 0 Rank 1]  using GPU 0 to perform barrier as devices used by this process are currently unknown. This can potentially cause a hang if this rank to GPU mapping is incorrect. Specify device_ids in barrier() to force use of a particular device, or call init_process_group() with a device_id.
Flash Attention 2.0 only supports torch.float16 and torch.bfloat16 dtypes, but the current dype in Qwen2ForCausalLM is torch.float32. You should run training or inference using Automatic Mixed-Precision via the `with torch.autocast(device_type='torch_device'):` decorator, or load the model with the `torch_dtype` argument. Example: `model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("openai/whisper-tiny", attn_implementation="flash_attention_2", torch_dtype=torch.float16)`
